==To Add:== The underlying values and guiding philosophy of CaribData. 

At its core, the project believes in data as a public good, the power of storytelling to drive engagement, and the need for ethical, inclusive, and context-sensitive data governance. 

It emphasizes regional equity, transparency, and innovation, particularly through tools like blockchain and open-source standards. 

CaribData operates on the belief that sustainable data systems are built not just on technology, but on trust, training, and partnerships.
