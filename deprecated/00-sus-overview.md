# Sustainability Overview

This page introduces the sustainability vision of the CaribData initiative. Sustainability is core to ensuring that the project’s impact continues beyond its formal funding period. This section outlines the foundational principles that guide our approach — including institutional ownership, financial resilience, technological relevance, and regional collaboration — all aimed at embedding CaribData’s tools, practices, and values into long-term development systems.
