# Sustainability

This page outlines the strategic roadmap for ensuring long-term sustainability of the infrastructure built under Component 1. It includes plans for scaling the data-sharing platform, expanding its thematic scope beyond climate and health, and integrating lessons learned from the blockchain pilot. The strategy is designed to attract ongoing investment and regional participation, helping to maintain and grow a resilient Caribbean data ecosystem beyond the lifetime of the IDB-funded program.
