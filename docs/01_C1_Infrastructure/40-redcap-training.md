# Training

This page describes the training programs developed under Component 1 to build regional capacity in the use of REDCap and related digital infrastructure tools. Participants received hands-on instruction in data entry, project design, access controls, and data export techniques â€” all grounded in best practices for ethical data management. The training ensured that National Statistical Offices and other stakeholders could use REDCap confidently and sustainably within their existing systems.
