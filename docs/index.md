# Welcome to the CaribData Document Repository

## About our Site

Mostly, we use this website to documents the outputs created during Phase 1 of our CaribData project.

We've divided the core of the site into 4 headings, representing the 4 project components as defined by our project funder, the Inter-American Development Bank.

- Component 1: Data Infrastructure
- Component 2: Data Storytelling
- Component 3: Data Policies & Guidelines
- Component 4: Project Coordination  

You can find these sections across the top of each web page. In a first [Overview](00_Overview/10-origins.md) section we cover our origins and objectives, and how we've operated the project. 

University projects tend to come and go, impactful for a while, then forgotten. We're determined that this won't be the case with CaribData. We've no magic bullet, but we're putting a lot of effort into understanding and experimenting with project sustainability. We cover this aspect [as a separate section](06_Sustainability/20-sus-plan.md).  

Finally - we talk to a lot of people about data, and about CaribData. We've gathered some of our more formal talks, presentations, and so on into a final section that we've called [Other Outreach](05_Other_Outreach/00-reach-overview.md). It's what we've love to do - talk about data!
