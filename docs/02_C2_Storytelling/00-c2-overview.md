# Storytelling Overview

This page introduces Component 2 of the CaribData initiative, which focuses on data storytelling as a vehicle for increasing data literacy, engagement, and impact across the Caribbean. This component combines research, communication, and training to help transform data into narratives that resonate with diverse audiences â€” from policymakers to the general public. Storytelling plays a central role in changing how Caribbean data is perceived, shared, and acted upon.
