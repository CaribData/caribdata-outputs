# Storytelling Datathon

This page describes the storytelling-focused datathon organized under Component 2, which brought together data analysts, content creators, and communication professionals to develop narrative products from real datasets. The event fostered collaboration across disciplines, promoted regional data sharing, and produced multimedia stories designed to inform and inspire. It also served as a demonstration of CaribDataâ€™s integrated approach to capacity building and communication.
