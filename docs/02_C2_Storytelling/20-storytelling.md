# Data Storytelling

This page explores the principles, practice, and power of data storytelling within the Caribbean context. It highlights the creation and dissemination of compelling narratives that use visualizations, case studies, and lived experiences to make data more accessible and impactful. The stories — focused primarily on health and climate resilience — illustrate how evidence-based communication can improve decision-making and inspire change.
