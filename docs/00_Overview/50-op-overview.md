# Project Outputs

Our CaribData outputs are organised into 4 project Components. These infrastructure outputs are designed to be scalable for the region.

??? note annotate "Component 1: Data Infrastructure"

    Key outputs from our data infrastructure work are listed below. Each output is described in detail in our section on [Data Infrastructure](../01_C1_Infrastructure/00-c1-overview.md)

    - __Data Assessments__ (1)
    
        We have performed an example data audit for one campus of the University of the West Indies, creating a resource kit of datasets, data producers, and potential data stories. For more information, [follow this link.](../01_C1_Infrastructure/10-assessment.md) 
    
    - __REDCap Data Infrastructure__ (2)

        We have developed and are managing a free-for-use platform (REDCap) databasing software for secure data collection and data storage. We are offering this platform to data producers requiring a best-practice regional solution for electronic data capture. For more information, [follow this link.](../01_C1_Infrastructure/30-redcap.md) 

    - __Storytelling Infrastructure__ (3)

        We are developing an innovative platform that ingests data, creates data insights, and using those insights builds narratives tailored to multiple audiences. This is the exploratory part of our work, and we're employing the latest AI automation in our platform. For more information, [follow this link.](../02_C2_Storytelling/20-storytelling.md).

    - __REDCap Training & Support__ (4)

        Based on specific requests from our NSO beneficiaries, we have developed two REDCap training courses for NSO employees, one for platform users, one for platform administrators. We also provide same-day REDCap support for our REDCap data producers. For more information training, [follow this link.](../01_C1_Infrastructure/40-redcap-training.md).

    Key outputs from our data storytelling work are listed below. Each output is described in detail in our section on [Data Storytelling](../02_C2_Storytelling/00-c2-overview.md)

    - __Data Stories & Storytelling Infrastructure__ (1)
    
        We see this as a key deliverable for our project. We're developiing a process for the creation of impactful data stories, using data insights to build stories tailored to specific audiences. As a development arm of our project, we're also building a bespoke infrastructure to automate aspects of this process, using LLM and AI insight generation. For more information on our storytelling, [follow this link](../02_C2_Storytelling/20-storytelling.md). For more information on our storytelling infrastructure, [follow this link.](../02_C2_Storytelling/25-storytelling-infrastructure.md) 
    
    - __Storytelling Training__ (2)

        We've created a 6-part storytelling training programme to help data producers develop data stories from their data. For more information, [Follow this link.](../02_C2_Storytelling/30-training.md).  

    - __The Storython__ (3)

        Linked to our storytelling training, we're organising a 'storython' - a competition where teams are asked to create compelling insights and stories from a pre-defined data resource. Prizes are available for winning entrants. For more information, [Follow this link.](../02_C2_Storytelling/40-datathon.md).  

    - __Academic Outputs__ (4)

        We're producing peer-reviewed academic outputs, created as part of our specific outreach to data producers, data decision-makers, and the research community. For more information [Follow this link.](../02_C2_Storytelling/50-articles.md)
