# Project Objectives

## Our Philosophy 
We believe in data as a public good, the power of storytelling to drive engagement, and the need for ethical, inclusive, and context-sensitive data governance. 

We are pushing for our project to always be transparent and inovative - using the latest fast-moving developments in large-language modelling and artificial intellignece to create products for the public good. 

At CaribData, we operates on the belief that sustainable data systems are built not just on technology, but on trust, training, and partnerships.

## Project Aim
Our CaribData longer-term aim is to transform the Caribbean’s ability to manage, share, and benefit from data. We're looking to generate lasting impact by ensuring that data is actively used to tell compelling stories that drive policy and innovation.

## Project Objectives & Goals
The project objectives, as written in the original [IDB-UWI Technical Cooperation Agreement](../downloads/Agreement - CaribData. Caribbean DataDriven Resilience.pdf) (May 18, 2023) are as follows:

!!! quote "CaribData Objectives"

    The Project objectives are to improve the infrastructure for data sharing and data 
    resilience at the regional level. The project targets capacity building within National 
    Statistical Offices (“NSOs”) to increase the quality of existing datasets by providing training 
    and mentoring and to increase the regional data sharing capacity through a communication 
    program led by a focus on data journalism/data stories, and including analysis a mix of workshops, datathons, conferencing.
