# Governance

This page describes the governance framework established for CaribData, including the guiding principles, decision-making structures, and operational protocols. It covers how authority is delegated, how strategic direction is set, and how compliance with both regional and IDB standards is maintained. The governance model emphasizes decentralized, transparent, and collaborative management.

# Project Steering Committee (PSC)

Each beneficiary country appointed one representative (National Focal Point) from each NSOs (Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago) who sits on the Project Steering Committee (PSC). Each focal point is responsible for helping build consensus with stakeholders. Representatives from the IDB  act in an advisory role. The Executing Agency (UWI) is the Secretary to the PSC. The PSC has met quarterly through the life of the report.

# Weekly CaribData Meetings

# IDB Reporting

We submit Semi-Annual Progress Reports to the Bank describing the implementation of the activities of the Project. Each report is  submitted within sixty (60) days after the end of each university Semester. 

A final report will be submitted within six months after the completion of the last project activity. The final report will present to the Bank the degree of fulfillment of the output indicators and progress toward the outcomes of the Results Matrix. 

This final evaluation will assess the program’s relevance, effectiveness, efficiency levels, and sustainability, and identify lessons learned and opportunities for improvement. The evaluation will inform mechanisms for improving the incentives for coordinating action around creating, managing, and sharing quality data.
