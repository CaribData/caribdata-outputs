# Outreach Overview

This page introduces the outreach and engagement efforts of the CaribData initiative that fall outside of its core project components. These efforts extend the reach and visibility of CaribData, helping to connect regional audiences, global networks, and diverse stakeholders to the initiativeâ€™s goals and outcomes. Outreach plays a vital role in building public trust, attracting collaboration, and promoting the Caribbean as a data-savvy region.
