While our early efforts focused on open health data, our broader aim has always been to encourage data sharing across disciplines and countries. At the heart of our approach is the belief that storytelling can help make data more meaningful and foster a stronger culture of sharing. </p> <p>While storytelling is a powerful goal, it\u2019s a new and unfamiliar skill for many data producers. In our resource-limited SIDS, building the systems and habits needed for regular, meaningful, audience-specific storytelling backed by shareable data is a major challenge. It's a journey, not a quick fix. </p> <p>By strengthening capacity, improving infrastructure, and building trust, we hope to support better use of the data we already collect\u2014guided by our own Caribbean priorities and realities.</p> <p>You can read more about our ideas behind data-sharing and storytelling in these articles, from our project lead, Ian Hambleton.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/10-origins/#articles","title":"Articles","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Data Availability in Small Islands  </p> </li> <li> <p> Embracing Open Data  </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"00_Overview/10-origins/#our-original-project-justification","title":"Our Original Project Justification","text":"<p>Abstract</p> <p>The Caribbean is producing more and more digital data every year, yet much of it remains scattered, hard to access, or underused. While other regions have built strong systems for sharing and using data, the Caribbean still faces big gaps\u2014especially when it comes to planning for disasters, tackling climate change, supporting health, or making smart decisions for development.</p> <p>CaribData is a regional effort to change that. Led by The University of the West Indies, the project is building a stronger foundation for sharing, using, and learning from data across the Caribbean. It focuses on three big goals:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Better infrastructure \u2013 Create a shared regional data hub to store and connect valuable public datasets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stronger skills \u2013 Train and mentor people across the region in how to analyze, share, and tell stories with data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bigger impact \u2013 Use real data to tell powerful stories that inform policy, inspire action, and improve lives.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Open data is a public good, but in the Caribbean, it\u2019s often locked away or underused. That\u2019s a missed opportunity. CaribData treats poor access to data as a barrier to progress\u2014and aims to change that by promoting policies, training, and tools to unlock its value.</p> <p>Through datathons, workshops, and storytelling, the project brings together governments, researchers, and communities to solve real challenges\u2014starting with climate and health. It also promotes innovation, including the citizen-science led datathon and its use of large-language models and AI to build a prototype storytelling platform.</p> <p>CaribData is just the beginning. With a scalable model and a regional approach, the project lays the groundwork for a future where Caribbean data is more open, more useful, and more powerful\u2014for everyone.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/20-idb-award/","title":"The Award","text":"<p>The CaribData project has been funded through the Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s (IDB) Regional Public Goods (RPG) Initiative\u2014a competitive mechanism that supports projects promoting regional cooperation to address shared challenges across Latin America and the Caribbean; the IDB is the leading source of development financing for the region, committed to improving lives through sustainable, inclusive economic and social progress.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/20-idb-award/#idb-project-classification","title":"IDB Project Classification","text":"Country Regional Project Number RG-T4186 Approval Date December 1, 2022 Project Status Implementation Project Type Technical Cooperation Sector SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Subsector ICT (INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY) Lending Instrument - Lending Instrument Code - Modality - Facility Type - Environmental and Social Impact Category (ESIC) - Total Cost USD 685,000.00 Country Counterpart Financing USD 165,000.00 Original Amount Approved USD 520,000.00"},{"location":"00_Overview/20-idb-award/#project-documents-submitted-to-idb","title":"Project Documents Submitted to IDB","text":"<ul> <li> <p> IDB-UWI Technical Cooperation Agreement (May 18, 2023) </p> </li> <li> <p> IDB Technical Coorperation Information (Dec 01, 2022) </p> </li> <li> <p> UWI Commitment Letter (Dec 01, 2022) </p> </li> <li> <p> Procurement Plan (Dec 01, 2022) </p> </li> <li> <p> Procurement Plan Update 1 (Sep 22, 2023) </p> </li> <li> <p> Procurement Plan Update 2 (Aug 07, 2024)</p> </li> <li> <p> IDB Results Matrix (Dec 01, 2022) </p> </li> <li> <p> General CaribData Procurement Notice (Sep 22, 2023) </p> </li> <li> <p> CaribData Early ToR - Component 1 (Dec 01, 2022) </p> </li> <li> <p> Specific Procurement Notice - Component 1 (Jan 03, 2024) </p> </li> <li> <p> Specific CaribData Procurement Notice - Component 2 (Jan 03, 2024) </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"00_Overview/40-objectives/","title":"Project Objectives","text":""},{"location":"00_Overview/40-objectives/#our-philosophy","title":"Our Philosophy","text":"<p>We believe in data as a public good, the power of storytelling to drive engagement, and the need for ethical, inclusive, and context-sensitive data governance. </p> <p>We are pushing for our project to always be transparent and inovative - using the latest fast-moving developments in large-language modelling and artificial intellignece to create products for the public good. </p> <p>At CaribData, we operates on the belief that sustainable data systems are built not just on technology, but on trust, training, and partnerships.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/40-objectives/#project-aim","title":"Project Aim","text":"<p>Our CaribData longer-term aim is to transform the Caribbean\u2019s ability to manage, share, and benefit from data.
