While our early efforts focused on open health data, our broader aim has always been to encourage data sharing across disciplines and countries. At the heart of our approach is the belief that storytelling can help make data more meaningful and foster a stronger culture of sharing. </p> <p>While storytelling is a powerful goal, it\u2019s a new and unfamiliar skill for many data producers. In our resource-limited SIDS context, building the systems and habits needed for regular, meaningful, audience-specific storytelling backed by shareable data is a major challenge. It's a journey, not a quick fix. </p> <p>By strengthening capacity, improving infrastructure, and building trust, we hope to support better use of the data we already collect\u2014guided by our own Caribbean priorities and realities.</p> <p>You can read more about our ideas behind data-sharing and storytelling in these articles, from our project lead, Ian Hambleton.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/10-origins/#articles","title":"Articles","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Data Availability in Small Islands  </p> </li> <li> <p> Embracing Open Data  </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"00_Overview/20-idb-award/","title":"The Award","text":"<p>To Add: Describe the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Regional Public Goods (RPG) award that funds CaribData. </p> <p>To Add: Funding ($600,000), and how CaribData aligns with the IDB\u2019s Vision 2025 and priorities around digital transformation and climate resilience. </p> <p>To Add: The award represents international validation of the Caribbean's leadership potential in regional data governance and supports the establishment of cutting-edge tools such as blockchain for data provenance.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/30-philosophy/","title":"Project Philosophy","text":"<p>To Add: The underlying values and guiding philosophy of CaribData. </p> <p>At its core, the project believes in data as a public good, the power of storytelling to drive engagement, and the need for ethical, inclusive, and context-sensitive data governance. </p> <p>It emphasizes regional equity, transparency, and innovation, particularly through tools like blockchain and open-source standards. </p> <p>CaribData operates on the belief that sustainable data systems are built not just on technology, but on trust, training, and partnerships.</p>"},{"location":"00_Overview/40-objectives/","title":"Project Objectives","text":"<p>To Add: CaribData Core Objectives.
